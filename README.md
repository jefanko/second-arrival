# Short History
This project was started in 2020 when the pandemic agressively spreading. The project was built with RPG Maker MV engine, and this was actually my first personal project. I started this project because of my love for rpg games, especially Final Fantasy. 
# Development
This project only uses default plugin and default assets. I might try some other plugins and assets in the future, just wait for the next update. 
I initially planned this project to consist of only one part. But because I felt it would take too much time to do it alone, I divided this project into 5 parts. 
# Download
You can download the game on the release section of this repository.
